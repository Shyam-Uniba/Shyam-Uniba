*The lines have to be like:
*
*type_of_padShape ID required_data
*
*with type_of_padShape: p for PndTpcPadShapePolygon or s for PndTpcPadShapeSquare
*examples(without leading *)
*s 0 1
*means a PndTpcPadShapeSquare with ID=0 and width=1 (and for a square that's all)
*p 0 0.5 0.5 0.5 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 -0.5 0.5
*means a PndTpcPadShapePolygon with the same measure.
*Note that a line may not have more than 255 characters.
